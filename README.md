### 🚀 Getting Started / Installation
Follow these steps to get the application up and running in your local environment:

1. Clone the repo
``` git clone https://github.com/CeezR/TaskNexus ```

| Steps                            | Front-end                 | Back-end                  |
| ---------------------------------| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 2. Navigate into repo            | `cd front-end`            | `cd back-end`             |
| 3. Install Dependencies          | `npm install`             | `mvn install`             |
| 4. Run the project               | `npm run dev`             | `mvn start`               |

### 🚧 Known Issues and Limitations:
Cold Storage Delay: The back-end is currently hosted on Azure, utilizing a cold storage mechanism. As a result, if the page remains inactive for a certain period of time, the back-end code is moved into "cold storage." Consequently, when a user accesses the page after this period of inactivity, there might be a slight delay of a few dozen seconds before the back-end responds to the front-end.
