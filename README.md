### ðŸš§ Known Issues and Limitations:
Cold Storage Delay: The back-end is currently hosted on Azure, utilizing a cold storage mechanism. As a result, if the page remains inactive for a certain period of time, the back-end code is moved into "cold storage." Consequently, when a user accesses the page after this period of inactivity, there might be a slight delay of a few dozen seconds before the back-end responds to the front-end.
